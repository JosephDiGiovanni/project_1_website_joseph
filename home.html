  <h1> Space Exploration </h1>
  <p> For ages, humans have wondered what lies beyond the stars. What is in the massive, dark abyss we call the universe. What else is out there? Will we have the technology to find out? These have all recently been very popular questions. We humans aren't meant to stay on Earth forever. Eventually, we will have to leave and move on to the next planet.</p>

  <p> NASA has been around for 58 years, and has been a main contributer to the study of astonomy, astrology, aerospace engineering, and astrophysics. NASA is one of the most significant scientific agencies in the the world. They've sent rovers like Pathfinder, Spirit, and Opportunity to Mars. With the Apollo 11 mission, Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. With the Hubble Telescope and the Kepler Astronnomical Observatory, we have been able to see images of planets in other star systems. </p>

<p> SpaceX is a space transporter and aerospace manufacturer. SpaceX's main goal is to eventually turn the colonization of Mars into a reality. SpaceX has made a few major breakthroughs, but the one that stood out to everybody was the unmanned sea landing of the rocket Falcon 9. After many failed attempts, on April 8th, 2016, SPaceX successfully remotely landed the Falcon 9 rocket on a barge in the middle of the ocean. This was the first time that an unmanned spacecraft was remotely landed, and this was a huge deal for SpaceX. SpaceX has opened a whole new door of possibilities with space cargo transporting.</p>
