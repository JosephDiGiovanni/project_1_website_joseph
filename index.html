    <h1> Extra-Terrestrial Life</h1>

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto" rel="stylesheet">
    <p> There are questions we may never to be able to answer. Why are we here? What is the meaning of life? What is our purpose? One of these questions stand out to me.</p>
    <p> Are we alone in the universe? </p>
    <p>This question has fascinated me for a while. For decades, many people have contemplated this question. From E.T. to No Man's Sky and even to Morgan Freeman. </p>

    <p style="clear: both;"> August 29th, the private institute SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) recieved a radio wave from deep space. </p>
    <img id="image123" src="https://stocklogos-pd.s3.amazonaws.com/setitop.jpg" width="335">
    <p> Many people have been speculating what this radio wave could possibly be. Because it came from the direction of a sun-like star, some scientists think that it could be a sign of extra-terrestrial life. Other researchers think it is terrestrial, and that it came from Earth.</p>
    <p> Unfortunately, a few days later, the theory of the signal being off planet was debunked. After looking into the signal several more times, SETI concluded that the signal was in fact terrestrial. The signal came from a Soviet satellite that had not been recognized as a celestial body. </p>
