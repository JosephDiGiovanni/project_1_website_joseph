  <h1> Planets </h1>
  <p> Scientists have been on the lookout for potentially habitable planets for if we ever had to leave Earth. NASA is currently using the Kepler Space Observatory to locate Earth-like planets in the event that Earth became uninhabitable. So far, Kepler has discovered 1,284 planets. These include Kepler 452b, Kepler 186f, and Kepler 22b.
